    <h1> My New start </h1>
    <div id="intro">
        <h2> My early career</h2>
        <p>I graduated with a BS in Chemistry for Warren Wilson College.
            When I graduated I moved to the Dominican Rep. where I worked as a chemistry teacher
            at the first STEM high school on the island. 
            I moved back to the USA in 2017 with the hope to continue my career in education.
            However things did not go as planned and I find myself in need of finding a new career path.
